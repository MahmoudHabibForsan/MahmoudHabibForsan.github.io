<p>In 1905, German born physicist Albert Einstein theorized that while the speed<br>
of light is constant, other things that seem constant- such as space and   
time- <br>are not. Space and time can change when measured relative to an objectmoving <br>
near the speed of light- about 186,000 miles per second. Since relative motion<br>
is the key to Einstein's idea, it is called the theory of relativity. Einstein's ideas<br>
had implications not only for science, but also for how people observed the world.
